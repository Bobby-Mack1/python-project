This project is the creation of a number guessing game in python. The player is given a certain number of guesses, dependent on the difficulty they have chosen, to guess a number between 1 and 100. They can then choose to play again once they have finished playing or quit the game.

Dependencies:
Python (coded using 3.12 however earlier versions will more than likely suffice)
An IDE/ notebook to run the python file e.g vscode, jupyter notebooks, pycharm etc…
Random module downloaded so that the file can generate a random number

File Guide:
GameScript – the script required to run and play the game
Flowchart – A flowchart showcasing the logic of the game and how it works
Video- A short walkthrough of the game and its logic

Executing file
1.	Download the gamescript file and ensure you have the random module downloaded
2.	Open the gamescript file in your chosen IDE 
3.	Run the file as a python file and follow instructions given in the terminal
